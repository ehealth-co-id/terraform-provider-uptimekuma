# {{ .ProviderShortName }} Provider

This Terraform provider allows you to manage [Uptime Kuma](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma) resources through Terraform. Uptime Kuma is a self-hosted monitoring tool similar to Uptime Robot.

## Features

- **Monitors**: Create and manage HTTP, Ping, Port, DNS, Keyword, and other monitor types
- **Status Pages**: Create and manage status pages with monitor groups and custom domains

## Requirements

- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads) >= 1.0
- Access to an Uptime Kuma instance (self-hosted or hosted)
- Uptime Kuma Web API adapter (see setup guide below)

## Setup Guide for Uptime Kuma Web API

Uptime Kuma uses WebSocket for its API rather than a traditional REST API. This provider requires the [Uptime Kuma Web API adapter](https://github.com/MedAziz11/Uptime-Kuma-Web-API) to bridge between standard REST calls and Uptime Kuma's WebSocket API.

### ⚠️ Version Compatibility

**Important:** The Uptime Kuma Web API adapter is only compatible with specific versions of Uptime Kuma. Using incompatible versions will result in API errors.

| Uptime Kuma Version | API Adapter Compatibility |
|---------------------|---------------------------|
| **1.21.3**          | ✅ Compatible (Recommended) |
| 1.22.x              | ⚠️ Untested |
| 1.23.x+             | ❌ Not Compatible |

When using newer versions of Uptime Kuma (1.23.x and above), you may encounter errors like:
- `request failed with status 500: {"detail":"'version'"}`
- Various WebSocket API incompatibilities

**We recommend using Uptime Kuma version 1.21.3** for reliable operation with this provider.
