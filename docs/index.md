# uptimekuma Provider

This Terraform provider allows you to manage [Uptime Kuma](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma) resources through Terraform. Uptime Kuma is a self-hosted monitoring tool similar to Uptime Robot.

## Features

- **Monitors**: Create and manage HTTP, Ping, Port, and Keyword monitor types
- **Status Pages**: Create and manage status pages with monitor groups and custom domains
- **Tags**: Create and manage tags for organizing monitors
- **Direct Socket.IO Connection**: Communicates directly with Uptime Kuma v2 (no middleware required)

## Requirements

- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads) >= 1.0
- Uptime Kuma v2 instance

## Version Compatibility

| Provider Version | Uptime Kuma Version | Connection Method |
|------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **v1.0.0+**      | **v2.x**            | Direct Socket.IO  |
| v0.x (deprecated)| v1.21.3             | HTTP Middleware   |

**⚠️ Breaking Change:** Version 1.0.0+ uses direct Socket.IO communication and is only compatible with Uptime Kuma v2. The HTTP middleware adapter is no longer required or supported.

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "uptimekuma" {
  base_url = "http://localhost:3001" # Direct Uptime Kuma URL (not middleware)
  username = "admin"
  password = "password"
}
```
